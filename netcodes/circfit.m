function   [xc,yc,R,a] = circfit(x,y)

%   [xc yx R] = circfit(x,y)
%
%   fits a circle  in x,y plane in a more accurate
%   (less prone to ill condition )
%  procedure than circfit2 but using more memory
%  x,y are column vector where (x(i),y(i)) is a measured point
%
%  result is center point (yc,xc) and radius R
%  an optional output is the vector of coeficient a
% describing the circle's equation
